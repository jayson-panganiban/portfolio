# Hey there! I'm Jayson üëã

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website. I'm Jayson, a QA Engineer who's passionate about breaking things (professionally, of course!) through automation and performance testing. My portfolio showcases my journey, skills, and the projects I've worked on across different industries.

## üíª The Tech Stack I Used

- **Next.js** since it's what I'm most comfortable with
- **TypeScript** because I like my code typed and predictable
- **Tailwind CSS** for making everything look good without the styling headaches
- **React** because, well, components are life!
- **npm** for keeping all my packages in check


## üìã What's Inside

As you click around, you'll find:

- A little intro about me and what I do
- My background in QA Engineering (spoiler: I love finding bugs!)
- My work history across various industries (I've been around!)
- Projects that showcase what I can do with code and testing
- Ways to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate

## üîß Want to Run This Locally?

If you're curious about how I built this or want to use it as inspiration, here's how to get it running on your machine:

   ```

4. **Check it out**
   Just point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're in!


5. **Customize the data**
   You can modify the portfolio content by editing:
   - `src/data/resume.ts` - Update your work history, skills, and other resume information
   - `src/data/projects.ts` - Add or modify your project showcase
   - Replace `public/resume.pdf` with your own resume PDF file


## üîÑ Handy Commands

When you're tinkering with the code, these will come in handy:

- `npm run dev` - See changes as you make them
- `npm run build` - Package everything up for production
- `npm start` - Run the production version locally
- `npm run lint` - Make sure your code is clean and tidy
